  <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
  <h3>BAKED MOCHI DONUTS</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 170°C</li>
    <li>In a medium sized saucepan heat the milk, sugar and oil until steaming</li>
    <li>Add the flour and mix until smooth</li>
    <li>Remove from heat and add the tapioca starch, mix until completely combined and a smooth ball</li>
    <li>Transfer the dough to another bowl and slowly add the beaten egg, stopping when the batter hangs down from the spatula in a V-shape</li>
    <li>Transfer batter to a piping bag fitted with a round nozzle and pipe onto baking paper or a silicone mat according to the stencil (make sure that the piped circles touch each other very slightly)</li>
    <li>Bake for 12 - 15 minutes or until lightly golden brown</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>STRAWBERRY GLAZE</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Melt the chocolate in the microwave or over a bain-marie</li>
    <li>Add the strawberries and blend with a blender until smooth</li>
    <li>Transfer to a small bowl and dip the donuts into the glaze</li>
    <li>Lift up and tap slightly on a flat surface to spread the glaze evenly</li>
    <li>Sprinkle with toppings if desired (I used crushed digestive biscuits)</li>
    <li>Set aside to allow glaze to set</li>
    <li><strong>TIP:</strong> With the leftover glaze, allow it to set in the fridge, shape them into balls and roll in matcha powder. Becomes a delicious truffle!</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>MATCHA GLAZE</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Melt the chocolate and white chocolate together in the microwave or over a bain-marie</li>
    <li>Add the matcha powder and mix until well combined</li>
    <li>Transfer to a smaller bowl and dip the donuts into the glaze</li>
    <li>Lift up and tap slightly on a flat surface to spread the glaze evenly</li>
    <li>Sprinkle with toppings if desired</li>
    <li>Set aside to allow glaze to set</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>NOTES</h2>
  <p>These are best consumed on the day they're made! As they are made from tapioca starch they will firm up over time, if they get a little hard place in the microwave for 10 seconds or so to soften.</p>
